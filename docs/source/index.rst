Welcome to einx's documentation!
================================

einx is a Python library that allows formulating many tensor operations as concise expressions using few powerful abstractions.
It is inspired by `einops <https://github.com/arogozhnikov/einops>`_ and `einsum <https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.einsum.html>`_.
